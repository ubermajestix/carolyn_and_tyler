        <h1>how they met</h1>
        <p>
        Carolyn was out for dinner with her good friend Katelyn at a
        favorite restaurant, The Kitchen Upstairs, in Boulder. As the
        dinner began to wrap up, Katelyn texted some of her friends to
        see if they wanted to meet up for an after dinner drink . Tyler
        so happened to be one of those friends and had just walked into
        The Kitchen Upstairs when Katelyn texted him. Since the table
        next to the girls was empty, Tyler took it upon himself to join
        Katelyn and Carolyn for the remainder of their dinner.  Before
        Carolyn knew it, Tyler was eating off of her plate and she was
        sharing sips of his fancy Belgium beer.  They chatted together
        like good friends who hadn’t seen each other in years. After
        awhile Katelyn began to feel like she was the 3rd wheel on this
        dinner date.  Tyler may have fallen in love when Carolyn told
        him she was in the Nerd Club in high school (he was in Math Club
        and marching band). That night turned into the worlds best, most
        natural kind of first date ever. They went dancing, ate a late
        night gyro on Pearl street, and shared a PBR at the dive bar in
        town.  Ever since that first night, Carolyn and Tyler have been
        enjoying great food, beer, and conversation together.

    <div class="tile the-gate" id="the-proposal">
      <div class='info'>
        <h1>The Proposal</h1>
        <p> 
        Tyler proposed Friday, June 7th, at their home in Lodi, California.
        As a happy circumstance this was their four year anniversary of
        meeting. Tyler concocted an at home proposal based on their guilty tv
        pleasure The Bachelorette, but he had to get the ring first.
        </p>


        <p> 
        Tyler had to drive to San Francisco (about 2.5 hours each way) to
        pick up the ring, but had to do it during a weekday so Carolyn wouldn’t
        know he had the ring. The first attempt was foiled, the jeweler called
        while Tyler was halfway to SF to say the ring was delayed. Getting
        caught in Bay Area traffic, he almost didn’t get back home in time for
        Carolyn not to know something was afoot. 
        
        <p>
        The next day, the jeweler confirmed the ring was ready and Tyler took
        off to the city again. He left Carolyn a message saying he was really
        "busy" so if she called him, he might not answer. Tyler made it to SF,
        had the ring in hand at the jewelry store and she called. She had
        finished school early and wanted to come by and get a coffee. Now,
        Tyler is always up to put work aside for a few minutes for a coffee,
        but he was 2 hours away. In a panic, he answered the phone and
        explained, in a short tone, that he was very busy and had "deadlines"
        and people were expecting his project to be finished that afternoon,
        which was not the case. Sadly, Carolyn said okay and hung up. That
        night she asked him, "Do you have the ring? I bet you have it, I know
        it!" Tyler not wanting to let on, answered with "Can I make up for our
        coffee date and take you out for a fro-yo?" 
        </p>

        <p>
        Diverting her proposal questions with the promise of sugary dessert bought him
        some time to ask her Dad for her hand in marriage, but he was leaving on a trip
        for two weeks. Tyler asked her Dad the next day and got the proposal ready for
        that Friday. He decided to propose at their home, its a place that is special
        to them both that they have worked together to make beautiful. He made an alter
        of candles and oil lamps, a path way of candles from the side yard through the
        backyard that she would follow when she got home from school. He made the
        mistake of putting the candles out too early in the hot Lodi sun (105&deg;) and
        they started to melt! He unplugged the garage door so she’d be forced to go
        through the side gate and along his path. She called and said she was on her
        way home. 
        
        <p>
        Tyler got everything ready, and assumed his position on the alter in
        the heat. She should have been home in 15 minutes but she stopped for
        groceries, continued onto the cheese shop and then picked up some good beer.
        Tyler was literally sweating out each minute waiting for her to arrive. She
        drove up, and saw his note on the non-functional garage directing her to the
        backyard. 
        </p>

        <p> 
        Not wanting the milk and groceries and beer to get hot, she loaded
        everything up and came into the backyard, stunned, she dropped the
        groceries, and proceeded down the pathway to a waiting and very nervous
        and excited Tyler. Tyler prepared a speech, none of which he now
        remembers, recited it the best he could through a shaky voice, and got
        on one knee and asked Carolyn to marry him and spend forever together.
        She said "YES!" and they both hugged and stuff. There was champagne and
        lots of calling of family and friends (everyone does this right?).
