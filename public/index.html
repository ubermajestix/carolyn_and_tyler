        <h1>How They Met</h1>
        <p>
        Carolyn was out for dinner with her good friend Katelyn at a
        favorite restaurant, The Kitchen Upstairs, in Boulder. As the
        dinner began to wrap up, Katelyn texted some of her friends to
        see if they wanted to meet up for an after dinner drink . Tyler
        so happened to be one of those friends and had just walked into
        The Kitchen Upstairs when Katelyn texted him. Since the table
        next to the girls was empty, Tyler took it upon himself to join
        Katelyn and Carolyn for the remainder of their dinner.  
        </p>
        <p>
        Before Carolyn knew it, Tyler was eating off of her plate and she was
        sharing sips of his fancy Belgium beer.  They chatted together like
        good friends who hadn't seen each other in years.   Tyler may have
        fallen in love when Carolyn told him she was in the Nerd Club in high
        school (he was in Math Club and marching band). That night turned into
        the worlds best, most natural kind of first date ever. They went
        dancing, ate a late night gyro on Pearl street, and shared a PBR at the
        dive bar in town.  Ever since that first night, Carolyn and Tyler have
        been enjoying great food, beer, and conversation together.

          <p class="intro">Tyler proposed Friday, June 7th, at their home in Lodi, California.
          As a happy circumstance...</p>
          <div id="short-story">
            <p> 
            Tyler proposed Friday, June 7th, at their home in Lodi, California.
            As a happy circumstance this was their four year anniversary of
            meeting. Tyler concocted an at home proposal based on their guilty tv
            pleasure The Bachelorette, but he had to get the ring first.
            </p>
            <p> 
            Not wanting the milk and groceries and beer to get hot, she loaded
            everything up and came into the backyard, stunned, she dropped the
            groceries, and proceeded down the pathway to a waiting and very nervous
            and excited Tyler. Tyler prepared a speech, none of which he now
            remembers, recited it the best he could through a shaky voice, and got
            on one knee and asked Carolyn to marry him and spend forever together.
            She said "YES!" and they both hugged and stuff. There was champagne and
            lots of calling of family and friends.

            <p> 
            Tyler proposed Friday, June 7th, at their home in Lodi, California.
            As a happy circumstance this was their four year anniversary of
            meeting. Tyler concocted an at home proposal based on their guilty tv
            pleasure The Bachelorette, but he had to get the ring first.
            </p>


            <p> 
            Tyler had to drive to San Francisco (about 2.5 hours each way) to
            pick up the ring, but had to do it during a weekday so Carolyn wouldn't
            know he had the ring. The first attempt was foiled, the jeweler called
            while Tyler was halfway to SF to say the ring was delayed. Getting
            caught in Bay Area traffic, he almost didn't get back home in time for
            Carolyn not to know something was afoot. 

            <p>
            The next day, the jeweler confirmed the ring was ready and Tyler took
            off to the city again. He left Carolyn a message saying he was really
            "busy" so if she called him, he might not answer. Tyler made it to SF,
            had the ring in hand at the jewelry store and she called. She had
            finished school early and wanted to come by and get a coffee. Now,
            Tyler is always up to put work aside for a few minutes for a coffee,
            but he was 2 hours away. In a panic, he answered the phone and
            explained, in a short tone, that he was very busy and had "deadlines"
            and people were expecting his project to be finished that afternoon,
            which was not the case. Sadly, Carolyn said okay and hung up. That
            night she asked him, "Do you have the ring? I bet you have it, I know
            it!" Tyler not wanting to let on, answered with "Can I make up for our
            coffee date and take you out for a fro-yo?" 
            </p>

            <p>
            Diverting her proposal questions with the promise of sugary dessert bought him
            some time to ask her Dad for her hand in marriage, but he was leaving on a trip
            for two weeks. Tyler asked her Dad the next day and got the proposal ready for
            that Friday. He decided to propose at their home, its a place that is special
            to them both that they have worked together to make beautiful. He made an alter
            of candles and oil lamps, a path way of candles from the side yard through the
            backyard that she would follow when she got home from school. He made the
            mistake of putting the candles out too early in the hot Lodi sun (105&deg;) and
            they started to melt! He unplugged the garage door so sheâ€™d be forced to go
            through the side gate and along his path. She called and said she was on her
            way home. 

            <p>
            Tyler got everything ready, and assumed his position on the alter in
            the heat. She should have been home in 15 minutes but she stopped for
            groceries, continued onto the cheese shop and then picked up some good beer.
            Tyler was literally sweating out each minute waiting for her to arrive. She
            drove up, and saw his note on the non-functional garage directing her to the
            backyard. 
            </p>

            Not wanting the milk and groceries and beer to get hot, she loaded
            everything up and came into the backyard, stunned, she dropped the

              <h3>By Air</h3>
              <p>Carmel is a little out of the way, the nearest airport is in
              Monterey (MRY) but flights can be expensive. Other options
              include flying into San Francisco (SFO) or San Jose (SJC).
              </p>
              <p>SFO is about 2+ hours from Carmel and SJC is about 60-90 minutes away.
              Highways between SFO and SJC are awful, it can take you hours to just get to San Jose!
              Airport transfers from SFO or SJC to Carmel cost about $60+ per person.
              </p>
              <p> We suggest renting a car, maybe team up with friends to
              share the cost, to make exploring Carmel and Big Sur is a little easier.  
              </p>
              <p>However, since Carmel is pretty small, you
              really don't need a car and parking can be a pain (ask your hotel
              about nightly parking rates).

              <h3>By Land</h3>
              <p> 
              The fast way from Lodi: head south on I-5 and hang a right at
              Anderson's Pea Soup. Head up an over the Coast Range on Hwy
              152/156. Jump on the 101 towards Monterey and hang a left and
              keep on Hwy 1 for about 17 miles then hang a right on Ocean Ave.
              You'll come down the hill and into Carmel.

              </p>
              </p>
              The scenic coastal way from Lodi: Head south on I-5 and catch 580
              headed towards the bay. Its a little confusing but you want to
              find Hwy 92 and go over the San Mateo Bridge. Follow 92 all the
              way to Half Moon Bay. Hang a left on Hwy 1 and follow it along
              the coast and stop for some baked goods in Davenport. Cruise
              through Santa Cruz and Monterey, then look for signs for Carmel
              and hang a left on Ocean Ave.

              Hopefully you can spy sea otters hanging out in the rough surf.  Several more
              trails are scattered down the Big Sur coast further on down Highway 1.
