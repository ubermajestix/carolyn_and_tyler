        <p>Carolyn and Tyler met in Boulder, Colorado in June of 2009. Carolyn
        was working as a manager at Anthropologie after graduating from the
        University of Colorado. Tyler was working as a software engineer for a
        local startup.</p>
        <p>
        After a long day of work, a friend invited Carolyn to a casual dinner
        at The Kitchen Upstairs.  Both Tyler and Carolyn frequented The
        Upstairs, as its known, but had never met each other.
        </p>
        <p class="less">
        As the dinner began to wrap up, her friend Katelyn texted some of her
        friends asking them to meet up for an after dinner drink .

        As the dinner began to wrap up, her friend Katelyn texted some of her
        friends asking them to meet up for an after dinner drink .
        Tyler so happened to be one of those friends and had just walked into
        The Upstairs. He made his way over to their table, and since the table
        next to the girls was empty, Tyler took it upon himself to join Katelyn
        and Carolyn for the remainder of their dinner.
        </p>
        <p class="more">
        Before Carolyn knew it, Tyler was eating off of her plate and she was
        sharing sips of his fancy Belgian beer.  They chatted together like
        good friends who hadn't seen each other in years.   Tyler may have
        fallen in love when Carolyn told him she was in the Nerd Club in high
        school (he was in Math Club and marching band). That night turned into
        the worlds best, most natural kind of first date. They went
        dancing, ate a late night gyro on Pearl street, and shared a PBR at the
        dive bar in town.  Ever since that first night, Carolyn and Tyler have
        been enjoying great food, beer, and conversation together.  
        </p>
        <p class="more">
        The couple loves enjoying great food, drinks, and music together and
        with friends to this day.  They hope to share a bit of that first
        night's magic with their wedding guests in Carmel this October.

        <p>
          Carolyn and Tyler now share a beautiful home together in Carolyn's hometown of Lodi, California.
          The couple moved to Lodi from Boulder so Carolyn could persue her masters degree in speech-language pathology.
          Tyler works remotely for LivingSocial.com as a software engineer. 
          They enjoy cooking, running, yoga, wine, gardening, and traveling throughout California.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of their weekend trips led them to Carmel and the BigSur coast.
          Feeling the sense of magic similar to Boulder, they knew it would be
          a great place to surround themselves with family and friends to
          celebrate their marriage.

            could through a shaky voice, and got down on one knee and asked
            Carolyn to marry him and spend forever together.  She said "YES!"

            <p> 
            Tyler proposed Friday, June 7th, at their home in Lodi, California.
            As a happy circumstance this was their four year anniversary of
            meeting. Tyler had planned an at home proposal for weeks,
            but he had to get the ring first.
            </p>

            <p> 
            Tyler had to drive to San Francisco (about 2.5 hours each way) to
            pick up the ring they had picked out together, but had to do it
            during a weekday so Carolyn wouldn't know he had the ring. His
            first attempt to pickup the ring failed, the jeweler called while
            Tyler was halfway to SF to say the ring was delayed. Getting caught
            in Bay Area traffic, he almost didn't get back home in time for
            Carolyn not to know something was up. 
            </p>

            <p>
            The next day, the jeweler confirmed the ring was ready and Tyler took
            off to the city again. He left Carolyn a message saying he was really
            "busy" so if she called him, he might not answer. Tyler made it to SF,
            had the ring in hand at the jewelry store and she called. She had
            finished school early and wanted to stop by his office and get a
            coffee. Now, Tyler is always up to get a coffee, but he was 2 hours
            away. In a panic, he answered the phone and explained, in a short
            tone that he was "very busy" and had "deadlines" so he couldn't get
            a coffee.  Carolyn reluctantly said okay and hung up. That night
            she relentlessly questioned him, "Do you have the ring? I bet you
            have it, I know it!" Tyler not wanting to let on, answered with
            "Can I make up for our coffee date and take you out for a fro-yo?" 
            </p>

            <p>
            Diverting her questioning with the promise of sugary dessert bought
            him some time to plan the proposal. He still had to ask her Dad for
            her hand in marriage, but he was leaving on a trip for two weeks and
            Tyler knew he couldn't keep the ring a secret that long.  Tyler
            asked her Dad the next day and he wholeheartedly gave his approval
            of their marriage plans.
            </p>

            <p>
            Tyler got proposal ready for that Friday.  He decided to propose at
            their home, its a place that is special to them both that they have
            worked together to make beautiful. He made a pathway of candles
            and oil lamps from the side yard through the backyard that she
            would follow when she got home from school. He made the mistake of
            putting the candles out too early in the hot Lodi sun (105&deg;)
            and they started to melt! He unplugged the garage door so she'd be
            forced to go through the side gate and follow his path. Minutes
            after completing the setup Carolyn called and said she was on her
            way home. 
            </p>

            <p>
            Tyler got everything ready, and assumed his position outside in the
            heat. She should have been home in 15 minutes but she stopped for
            groceries, continued onto the cheese shop and then picked up some
            good beer (what an awesome girlfriend!).
            Tyler was literally sweating out each minute waiting for her to
            arrive. She drove up, and saw his note on the non-functional garage
            directing her to the backyard.
            </p>

            <p> 
            Not wanting the milk and groceries and beer to get hot, she loaded
            everything up and came into the backyard, stunned, she dropped the
            groceries, and proceeded down the pathway to a waiting and very
            nervous and excited Tyler. Tyler prepared a speech, none of which
            he now remembers, recited it the best he could through a shaky
            voice, and got down on one knee and asked Carolyn to marry him and
            spend forever together.  She said "YES!" and they both hugged and
            stuff. There was champagne and lots of calling of family and
            friends.

              <p>
                Carmel is located on California's North Central Coast. The two
                major airports serving the area are SFO in San Francisco and
                SJC in San Jose. SFO is about 2 hours away by car and San Jose is
                about an hour to 90 minutes, depending on traffic.  An other
                option is flying into Monterey (MRY), only 7 miles from Carmel.
                </p>
                <p>
                Carmel is pretty small and you can get around easily without a
                car. If you want to explore the Big Sur coast, we recommend
                renting a car, maybe you can team up with friends and meetup in
                San Francisco and drive together. Airport transfers are
                available from SFO and SJC to Carmel.  Check with your hotel
                about parking accommodations.

              <p>
              From the Bay Area: Get to San Jose and pickup the 101 heading
              south for 50 miles. Follow signs for Monterey and Highway 1. Once
              on Highway 1 continue until you see signs for Carmel, about 17
              miles.
              </p>
              <p> 
              From Lodi: head south on I-5 and hang a right at
              Anderson's Pea Soup. Head up an over the Coast Range on Hwy
              152/156 for about 45 miles. Jump on the 101 and follow signs for
              Monterey. Then head south on Hwy 1 for about 17 miles then hang a
              right on Ocean Ave.  You'll come down the hill and into Carmel.
              </p>
              <p>
              The scenic coastal route: Make your way to Half Moon Bay and
              Highway 1. Follow Hwy 1 along the coast, make a stop in
              Davenport along the way. Cruise then next 60 mils through Santa
              Cruz and Monterey, then look for signs for Carmel and hang a left
              on Ocean Ave.

              There are a multitude of amazing hiking trails surrounding Carmel. We recommend
              heading over to Point Lobos State Park and hike the perimeter trail around the rocky point.
              Hopefully you can spy sea otters hanging out in the rough surf.  Several more
              trails are scattered down the Big Sur coast further on down Highway 1.
